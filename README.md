# research



I use this repository to record my learning process.

I'm very interested in mobile and wireless security. And wish to go futher on any research in cybersecurity. 



[research and simulation of cyberattacks in VANET](./VANET/research and simulation of Cyberattacks in VANET.md)

I have learned and analyzed VANET (Vehicular Ad hoc Networks), and have done the simulation of cyberattacks in VANET on different scenarios.  This project is based on veins platform, a simulation platform which could connect vehicles movement with network situation. However, it seems that there is few tutorials about veins, so I decide to share my experience of veins platform and VANET protocol.
