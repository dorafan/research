# research



I use this repository to record my learning experience.

I'm very interested in mobile and wireless security. And wish to go further on any cybersecurity  and network research.

[research and simulation of cyberattacks in VANET](https://github.com/dorafan/research/blob/main/VANET/research%20and%20simulation%20of%20Cyberattacks%20in%20VANET.md)

I have studied VANET (Vehicular Ad hoc Networks) and have done the simulation of cyberattacks in VANET on different scenarios. The influence of the attacks is also concluded based on the experiment data.  This project runs on the veins platform, a simulation platform connecting vehicle movement with network situations. However, there are few tutorials about veins, so I decided to share my veins platform and VANET protocol experience.

[Research on Webassembley Runtime Security (In Progress)](https://github.com/dorafan/research/tree/main/Webassembly)

webassembly is a specification, and has many different implementations. These runtimes are built in totally different way. How to find their potential semantic error efficiently is a problem. And I'm working on it with my instructor.

[Paper critique -- wireless and mobile security](https://github.com/dorafan/research/blob/main/paper%20critique/wireless%20and%20mobile%20security/list.md)

some notes about security paper I have read and discussed  with my group.

[Distributed System Project -- a basic cache system](https://github.com/dorafan/research/tree/main/DistSys)

this is my Distributed System course project, implement with my  team mates.  Simple, but I like it.
